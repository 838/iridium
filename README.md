# mp-readium

Unofficial Dart/Flutter port of some of the Readium 2 components, extracted from the Mantano app. The Readium architecture is described [here](https://github.com/readium/architecture).
The aim of this effort is to leverage Flutter's multiplatform capabilities to the limits in order to reach a unified codebase and minimize the platform-specific code. Developed and tested on Android and iOS first, large parts of the code should be reusable for desktop and web apps.
